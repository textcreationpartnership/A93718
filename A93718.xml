         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAving now given you a breife and cleane diſcovery of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſeverall Nations, Kingdomes and Common-wealths in the World which I have taken patnes to Collect from Choice Authors, of div<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:169828:32"/> our Condition ſtands, our lives and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes will be ſubject to all the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, a wofull Nation can expect from devouring Enemies: Conforming unto, and aſſiſting this Authority; We ſhall have the better of all Nations, wee ſhall by degrees ariſe to the moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hed Government, that ever was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſince the Creation; and when the Commonalty of ENGLAND, viz. the Yeomanry, after ſome yeares are ſitted for the work intended, it ſhall not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe them, that they have with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence acted ſo long a time without any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Frutes of their Labours, Sith then the Sole Dominion and power ſhall reſt in themſelves, after which univerſall peace and never more any Warres ſhall follow in ENGLAND, untill the day of the diſſolution of this earthly Fabrick.</p>
            <p>In the next place, I ſhall only put you in mind of the New Engagement, to be taken generally throughout the Nation, in regard it is of ſpeciall concernment to all. The expreſſe words of it (are theſe) as it is Ordered by the Parliament, viz. I DO DECLARE AND PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MISE,
<pb facs="tcp:169828:32"/> THAT I WILL BE TRVE AND FAITHFVLL TO THE COMMON-WEALTH OF ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND, AS THE SAME NOWIS ESTABLISHED, WITHOVT A KING OR HOVSE OF LORDS.</p>
            <p>For ſuch as make any doubt or ſcruple of taking this Engagement; I referre them to Mr. IOHN DVRYES Book, lately publiſhed, called Conſiderations, concerning the preſent Engagement, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it may lawfully be entred into, yea, or no, they are ſould at the Star, under St. PETERS Church in Corn-hill, or in Popes-head Ally; Licenſed by Maſter IOSEPH CARYLL.</p>
            <p>In my apprehenſion, he removeth all the ſtumbling blocks, and anſwereth all the Objections that can be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the taking of it, which may ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie all ſuch as ſhut not their Eyes againſt the light.</p>
            <p>The three Chiefe Objections are theſe, viz.</p>
